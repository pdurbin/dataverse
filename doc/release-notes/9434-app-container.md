Developers can experiment with running Dataverse in Docker: https://preview.guides.gdcc.io/en/develop/container/app-image.html

This is an image developers build locally. It is not meant for production use!

To provide a complete container-based local development environment, developers can deploy a Dataverse container from 
the new image in addition to other containers for the necessary dependencies: 
https://preview.guides.gdcc.io/en/develop/container/dev-usage.html

Please note that with this emerging solution we will sunset older tooling like `docker-aio` and `docker-dcm`.
We envision more testing possibilities in the future, to be discussed as part of the
[Dataverse Containerization Working Group](https://dc.wgs.gdcc.io). There is no roadmap yet, but you have been warned.
If there is some specific feature of these tools you would like to be kept, please [reach out](https://dc.wgs.gdcc.io).
